My work is inspired by a paper published in Cell this year: Kermany et al., 2018 Cell “Identifying Medical Diagnosis and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep learning” . 

The OCT images used in this study can be downloaded from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2
The set up Azure MAchine Learning Package for Computer Vision is https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure-machine-learning/computer-vision?view=azure-python

With the advantage of high-level python API that Azure Machine Learning Package for Computer Vision provides, we got the whole training and testing pipeline finished within a couple of hours and a better result compared with what's reported in the original paper.
